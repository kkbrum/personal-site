\noindent Errata for the textbook ``Statistical Theory for Data Analysis: an Introduction" will be posted here as they are received. \\

\noindent Please email Katherine at kbrum@wharton.upenn.edu if you believe there is an error in the book and it will be added.


\begin{enumerate}
\item[p. 230]  Solution to problem 3.7c) The probabilities subbed into the denominators of the conditional probability formulas were accidentally flipped. Here is a corrected version:

$\text{Prob}(L | O) = \frac{\text{Prob}(L\cap O)}{\text{Prob}(O)} = \frac{0.26}{0.6} = \frac{13}{30}.$
$\text{Prob}(O | L) = \frac{\text{Prob}(L\cap O)}{\text{Prob}(L)} = \frac{0.26}{0.3} =  \frac{13}{15}.$\smallskip

Since Prob($L | O$) $\neq$ Prob($L$) (and similarly Prob($O | L$) $\neq$ Prob($O$)), the two events are not independent.

\item[p. 232] Solution to problem 4.4) In the possible orders, THHHT is listed twice and THTHH is not listed.

\end{enumerate}
