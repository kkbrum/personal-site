abstract: In a prospective study of 31 925 men with 18 yr of follow-up, higher ejaculation frequency (EF) throughout adulthood was associated with lower rates of prostate cancer. To further explore this association, we evaluated whole transcriptome gene expression in the prostate tissue from study participants who developed prostate cancer between 1992 and 2004 (n = 157 tumor tissue, n = 85 adjacent normal). We tested for trends in gene expression according to the level of EF as self-reported in 1992 for ages 20–29 yr, 40–49 yr, and the year prior to the questionnaire, 1991. There were no associations between EF and gene expression in areas of tumor after accounting for multiple testing. In contrast, in the adjacent normal tissue, 409 genes and six pathways were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate ≤0.2 across categories of EF in 1991. These results suggest that ejaculation affects the expression of genes in the normal prostate tissue. The identified genes and pathways provide potential biological links between EF and prostate tumorigenesis.
